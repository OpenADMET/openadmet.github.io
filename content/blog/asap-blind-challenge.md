## Advancing Open Science with ASAP Discovery, OpenADMET and Polaris

OpenADMET is proud to collaborate with the [ASAP Discovery Consortium](https://asapdiscovery.org/) and [Polaris benchmarking platform](https://polarishub.io/) to launch an exciting computational blind challenge in small molecule drug discovery.
This challenge represents a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle real-world drug discovery problems and demonstrate cutting-edge approaches in molecular modeling and prediction.
This challenge aligns perfectly with OMSF’s and OpenADMET's missions, leveraging the expertise and data from the ASAP Discovery Consortium to foster community-driven innovation in open science and evaluate models on ADMET endpoints.

## The Challenge

Participants will work on real-world data from ASAP Discovery’s antiviral programs targeting SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV main proteases (Mpro). The challenge includes three sub-tasks:

**Potency Prediction:** Forecast drug potency for a blind compound set.

**ADMET Properties:** Predict critical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity endpoints.

**Ligand Posing:** Generate accurate ligand poses for MERS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro based on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro training data.

Each task uses experimental data from world-class institutions like the Weizmann Institute, the University of Oxford, and industry standard contract research organisations.

## How to Participate
The competition runs January 13 to March 10, 2025. Follow along and participate the competition page on Polaris Champions will present at the NIH AViDD ASAP [Open Science Forum](https://asapdiscovery.org/forum), and everyone is invited to help co-author the final publication. Join individually or form teams—collaboration is encouraged!
