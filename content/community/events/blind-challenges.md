### ASAP x Polaris x OpenADMET Blind Challenge

Blind challenges are a critical tool to evaluate and advance the current state of the art in computational molecular sciences, see [here](https://polarishub.io/blog/driving-innovation-in-drug-discovery-the-role-of-ml-competitions) for some recent blind challenges in drug discovery. Sharing of these sorts of learnings has led to innovations such as AlphaFold2 as with the CASP sequence of folding challenges.

OpenADMET is proud to collaborate with the ASAP Discovery Consortium and Polaris benchmarking platform to launch an exciting computational blind challenge in small molecule drug discovery. This challenge represents a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle real-world drug discovery problems and demonstrate cutting-edge approaches in molecular modeling and prediction. This challenge aligns perfectly with OMSF’s and OpenADMET’s missions, leveraging the expertise and data from the ASAP Discovery Consortium to foster community-driven innovation in open science and evaluate models on ADMET endpoints
