### OMSF Symposium 2025

OMSF Symposium 2025 was in Boston, Massachusetts. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof, especially one as beautiful as [Boston Museum of Science](https://www.mos.org/events/private-events) - an unforgettable experience!

If you missed the event this year or want to revisit it, we will have photos and videos available at a later date, so check back! The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from our project and our partner projects, Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold.

**Information**: Here is the [itinerary](https://omsf.io/community/events/) of the event.  


### ASAP x Polaris x OpenADMET Blind Challenge

Blind challenges are a critical tool to evaluate and advance the current state of the art in computational molecular sciences, see [here](https://polarishub.io/blog/driving-innovation-in-drug-discovery-the-role-of-ml-competitions) for some recent blind challenges in drug discovery. Sharing of these sorts of learnings has led to innovations such as AlphaFold2 as with the CASP sequence of folding challenges.

OpenADMET is proud to collaborate with the ASAP Discovery Consortium and Polaris benchmarking platform to launch an exciting computational blind challenge in small molecule drug discovery. This challenge represents a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle real-world drug discovery problems and demonstrate cutting-edge approaches in molecular modeling and prediction. This challenge aligns perfectly with OMSF’s and OpenADMET’s missions, leveraging the expertise and data from the ASAP Discovery Consortium to foster community-driven innovation in open science and evaluate models on ADMET endpoints

If you missed the event or want to hear from some participants in the challenge, you can watch our recording below.
