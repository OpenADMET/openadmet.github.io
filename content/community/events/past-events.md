### OMSF Symposium 2025

OMSF Symposium 2025 was in Boston, Massachusetts. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof, especially one as beautiful as [Boston Museum of Science](https://www.mos.org/events/private-events) - an unforgettable experience!

If you missed the event this year or want to revisit it, we will have photos and videos available at a later date, so check back! The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from our project and our partner projects, Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold.

**Information**: Here is the [itinerary](https://omsf.io/community/events/) of the event.
