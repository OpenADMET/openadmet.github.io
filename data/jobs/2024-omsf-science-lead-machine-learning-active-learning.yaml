summary: |
  The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is seeking a Science Lead for the OpenADMET project (OpenADMET.org), specializing in Machine Learning Models and Active Learning Strategies.
  The Science Lead will be responsible for overseeing the selection, implementation, and refinement of machine learning models and active learning strategies to drive the development of open source ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) models built from both public datasets and newly generated open ADMET datasets generated by the collaborative OpenADMET project.
  This position supervises and collaborates with scientific roles on the OMSF OpenADMET team, collaborates closely with the OpenADMET technical team to aid the development of robust training and inference infrastructure, and provides domain expertise for optimizing machine learning model development and deployment.
  This role is also instrumental in recruiting and liaising with a Technical Advisory Committee consisting of experts from academia and industry to advise on model strategies that maximize the utility of new open ADMET data generated by the project.
  The Science Lead will work remotely in collaboration with diverse teams, primarily based in Europe, Australia, and the United States, and may require occasional travel.
  
  This fully remote, grant-funded position has a minimum duration of 2 years, with potential for extension based on available funding.
  The Science Lead will report directly to the OpenADMET Project Director.
