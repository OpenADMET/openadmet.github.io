  The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is seeking a Senior Scientist specializing in Data Curation and Pipeline Integration for the OpenADMET project (OpenADMET.org).
  This role focuses on ensuring the accuracy, quality, and accessibility of ADMET data used for machine learning applications, while developing and optimizing data workflows for seamless data ingestion, processing, and dissemination.
  The Senior Scientist will collaborate with experimental scientists at Octant/UCSF and the OpenADMET team to establish best practices for data curation and workflow integration.
  This includes preparing data in machine learning ready formats and managing data deposition into FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) repositories and ensuring the quality and reliability of all ADMET dataset classes.

  This fully remote, grant-funded position has a minimum duration of 2 years, with potential for extension depending on available funding. Due to time zone differences, occasional meetings outside standard business hours may be necessary.
  Our teams are primarily based in Europe, Australia, and the United States, and some travel may occasionally be required.
  The Senior Scientist – Data Curation and Pipeline Integration will report directly to the OpenADMET project lead, while closely collaborating with the OpenADMET ML Infrastructure team, project stakeholders, and external partners.
  This role is ideal for a resourceful individual eager to shape data-driven projects that advance ADMET research in a collaborative, open-source environment.
